# Project purpose

The project is an AI research assistant. It can read papers (served as PDFs and other formats) and search the web for information related to a paper. It uses Tauri 2.0 as the app framework with React.js for the frontend (all code in TypeScript). It can query the API of DeepSeek, Azure AI Foundry, or Ollama for LLM service.
